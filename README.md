3. Description
he proposed system aims to create a social platform and using various architectures and concepts in the dawn. The project may be divided into three major segments -▪Chatting–For this, we utilize Socket.io to establish a signal, and then make a P2P bi-directional channel between the two clients for chatting.

▪Service -Service is a feature which will help residents of the same neighbourhood, the old, the sick and the needy by performing service-request between the members of the neighbourhoodand thus in turn, helping those in need. This will be done using real-time database, and prompts. (Module currenly under development)
